Welcome to RideHop, a website I developed in ORF401: Electronic Commerce using Django. RideHop connects event registrants who may benefit from traveling together to or from events, saving money, and enjoying companionship. Our platform fosters an environment where paired individuals find it advantageous to share a ride.
