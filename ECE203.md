Using an LM386 audio amplifier, my group created a circuit that displays the voltage of computer audio on an oscope. 

## Operational Amplifier Lab

I designed a circuit using an op-amp as a voltage comparator. Because the op-amp is an open loop configuration, the op-amp will always be saturated at +15V or -15V due to its extremely high gain. The oscope shows a square wave, which is exactly what we expect.

I used the virtual short approximation to solve this circuit.

I designed a circuit using the op-amp as an inverting amplifier. The oscope displays how the output signal is an inverted version of the input signal.

In the final part of the lab, I built a timer 555 IC circuit. 

## Capacitive Touchscreen Lab

In this project, I worked with capacitive touchscreens to create an interactive system using an Arduino. The system is designed to play audio and control LEDs based on touch coordinates.

- Touchscreen Interaction: Developed an Arduino program to detect touch coordinates on a capacitive touchscreen. Depending on where the screen is touched, the system plays an audio clip indicating "East" or "West."  
- LED Control: Connected blue and red LEDs to a breadboard, ensuring they are used in series with appropriate resistors to avoid damage. The blue LED lights up if the touch corresponds to "East," while the red LED lights up for "West."  
- Serial Monitoring: Implemented code to print the touch coordinates (along the shorter axis) on the Arduino serial monitor for debugging and demonstration purposes.  
- Circuit Design: Designed a circuit with careful consideration of resistor values to protect the LEDs and ensure accurate touch detection.

## Oscilloscope and Arbitrary Function Generator Familiarity Lab

We accurately measured two different sine, square, ramp, and pulse waves using the oscilloscope.

After tying the grounds, we measured the sine wave generated by the Arbitrary Function Generator using the oscilloscope.
