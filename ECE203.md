Using an LM386 audio amplifier, my group created a circuit that displays the voltage of computer audio on an oscope. 

## Operational Amplifier Lab

I designed a circuit using an op-amp as a voltage comparator. Because the op-amp is an open loop configuration, the op-amp will always be saturated at +15V or -15V due to its extremely high gain. The oscope shows a square wave, which is exactly what we expect.

I used the virtual short approximation to solve this circuit.

I designed a circuit using the op-amp as an inverting amplifier. The oscope displays how the output signal is an inverted version of the input signal.

[Timer 555 IC Demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/NJTk6giwyGM?feature=share)

In the final part of the lab, I built a timer 555 IC circuit. The red or blue LED will blink depending on whether the capacitor is charging or discharging. The demo includes a different timer 555 IC circuit I built. In the demo, there are two potentiometers: One controls the frequency while the other controls the brightness of the LED.

## Capacitive Touchscreen Lab

[Capacitive Touchscreen Demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/MflBNXmK_aI?feature=share)

I worked with capacitive touchscreens to create an interactive system using an Arduino. Depending on where the screen is touched, the system plays an audio clip indicating "East" or "West." Additionally, I connected blue and red LEDs to a breadboard, with the blue LED lighting up if the touch corresponds to "East" and the red LED lighting up for "West." 

## Oscilloscope and Arbitrary Function Generator Familiarity Lab

We accurately measured two different sine, square, ramp, and pulse waves using the oscilloscope.

After tying the grounds, we measured the sine wave generated by the Arbitrary Function Generator using the oscilloscope.
